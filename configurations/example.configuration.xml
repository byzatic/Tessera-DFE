<!--
The graphCalculationCronCycle is a string that defines the schedule for periodic tasks using the cron format.
It typically consists of six fields separated by spaces:
  1. Seconds (0–59)
  2. Minutes (0–59)
  3. Hours (0–23)
  4. Day of Month (1–31)
  5. Month (1–12 or JAN–DEC)
  6. Day of Week (0–7 or SUN–SAT, where both 0 and 7 represent Sunday)
Each field can contain specific values, ranges, lists, or wildcards to set the schedule precisely. For example:
    - "0 0/5 * * * ?" runs every 5 minutes.
    - "0 15 10 * * ?" runs at 10:15 AM every day.
    - "0 0 12 1/5 * ?" runs every fifth day at noon.
In Java libraries like Quartz, the cron expression is used to specify when the task should execute, with each
part interpreted in the context of time units from seconds to days of the week.
