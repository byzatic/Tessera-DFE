/**
 * Represents a hierarchical directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure of named nodes with:
 * - one or more root nodes (nodes without incoming edges),
 * - acyclic and directed relationships between nodes,
 * - support for multiple parents per jpa_like_node_repository,
 * - logical hierarchy layered by domain-specific levels (e.g., jpa_like_project_global_repository → group → host → hardware).
 * <p>
 * This structure models flexible but cycle-free data topologies used for:
 * - dependency resolution in data aggregation,
 * - distributed workflow modeling,
 * - configuration inheritance in monitoring systems.
