# Tessera Data Flow Engine
Tessera Data Flow Engine is a modular execution system based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), designed to build flexible and extensible data processing pipelines. Each module (service/routine) represents an independent node that processes data and passes the result along the execution graph.
