# Tessera-DFE
Tessera Data Flow Engine is a modular execution system based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), designed to build flexible and extensible data processing pipelines. Each module (or “tessera” tile) represents an independent node that processes data and passes the result along the execution graph.
